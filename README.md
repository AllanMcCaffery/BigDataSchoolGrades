# BigDataSchoolGrades

This project was my degree class Big Data coursework. The program was written in python 3 which import an excel spreadsheet dataset consisting of student data. The data was pre-processed to check for missing values, and converted to allow the data to be analysed using regression techniques. The program produced a heatmap and histograms.
